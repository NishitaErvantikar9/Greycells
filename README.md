# Greycells




## Getting Started
1. clone from gihub
2. open in vs code
3. Type this in terminal

        npm i 
4. run with nodemon
 
        nodemon
5. open localhost:3000 in browser 

## Overview
Almost everything is done except aws integration for which I can write post routes using amazon sdk. I would need more details for that , like which kind of account are we using and what kind of database. It just single file code to be written for storing the contact us form details.


## Minor issues
1. Font awesome or any other icons are not working, spent too much time on it. Let's keep this one for later.
2. Linkedin says Greycells page does not exist.
