# Greycells

Hi Kaka!
This repo contains all the codes, images and documents.
So, basically I have created two versions: 

|---|---|
|   |   |   
|   |   |   

1. Same design. 
2. A different UI to the same content available.

- Both are responsive. Both are done with basic HTML, CSS , Javascript and Bootstrap. No other libraries used.
- Both are Full stack, that is a form on submission will go to any database we attach to. AWS is in our case. 
- Both are SEO friendly too.

> Any changes in the second one, can be made according to what you like.
> We can completely discard that as well. No problem at all.
> Just to explore the potential of greys .

Let me know if want to elevate it more with more scroll animations or any javascript animations. I am Here! we will do it.
